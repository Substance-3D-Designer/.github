## About Substance 3D Designer

Developed by **Adobe**, Substance 3D Designer has become the foundation of **procedural texturing** across the creative industry. It allows artists to generate materials and patterns that can be endlessly modified without quality loss.  

Instead of painting textures manually, designers create **node graphs** defining every property of a surface — from base color to micro-detail. This makes it ideal for **physically based rendering (PBR)** workflows in film, games, and 3D design.  

Its deep integration with **Substance 3D Painter**, **Sampler**, and **Stager** ensures a complete, production-ready ecosystem. From a single material graph, you can export **base color, normal, roughness, metallic, and displacement** maps for any rendering pipeline.  

Substance 3D Designer is the ultimate creative lab for materials — flexible, scalable, and artist-driven.
